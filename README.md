CBOT (**C**ollaboration **B**ased **O**nline **T**eaching) is an interactive, in-class teaching tool that can be used to enhance learning and student engagement for introductory web development courses. 

The app is based on a few key observations:
* Hands-on coding is critical to the learning of a student in programming classes. As students turn new knowledge and concepts into code, the learning is reinforced.
* In such a setting, the teacher might find it challenging to manage all his students, who progress at different rates. He might have to move around the class physically to check in on their progress and get a gauge of the proportion of the students who completed the exercise, before deciding to move on.  
* Fast learners should be encouraged to help others. Research has shown that teaching someone is the best way to consolidate and reinforce learning, hence, it is a good idea to get faster students to help slower ones. 
* Instructors also need a more convenient way to review their students' code! (no downloading zip files manually)
